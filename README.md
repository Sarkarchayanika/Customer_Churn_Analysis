# Customer_Churn_Analysis (EDA Only)
Welcome to my Customer Churn Analysis project! This repository contains an in-depth **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a telecom dataset to identify patterns and trends associated with customer churn.

## Overview

Customer churn refers to when a customer stops doing business with a company. In this project, I analyze customer data to uncover key insights and visualize important factors contributing to churn.

This is an **EDA-only** project, ideal for business understanding and identifying which features may influence customer retention. Machine Learning models will be added in a future update.

## Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle - Telco Customer Churn Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)
- **Size**: ~7,000 rows, 21 columns
- **Features include**:
  - Demographics (gender, senior citizen, partner, dependents)
  - Account info (tenure, contract, payment method)
  - Services (internet, phone, streaming)
  - Target variable: `Churn`

---

## Objective

- Perform exploratory analysis to understand churn behavior.
- Identify trends and patterns in key variables.
- Create meaningful visualizations for business insight.
- Prepare data understanding groundwork for future ML modeling.

---

## Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas`, `numpy` â€“ Data handling
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` â€“ Visualizations
  - `plotly` â€“ Interactive plots (optional)

---

## Key Insights from EDA

- Customers with **month-to-month contracts** have higher churn rates.
- **Electronic Check** is the most common payment method among churned users.
- **Shorter tenure** correlates strongly with higher churn.
- **Fiber optic internet service** users tend to churn more than DSL users.

> ðŸ“Œ These patterns suggest areas where businesses can take proactive steps to improve customer retention.
